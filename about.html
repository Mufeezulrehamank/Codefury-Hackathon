				<h1>About</h1>
				 <p>Startups are defined as organizations formed to develop new innovations in identifiable and investable forms with the goal to significantly impact and disrupt the current market. The inclusion of the word ‘innovation’ in this definition is no accident—startups must be innovative in order to create ripples in their given industry, especially in the tech industry. We put together a list of six tech startups that are using their innovative thinking to help save the world, whether that is in the form of saving the planet or helping people in the world. </p>

				 	<p>Indian startups are redefining the country's economy. The subcontinent has become highly conducive to the startup culture. Its momentum is building tremendously, and the rapid integration of technology is making it happen, opening up several opportunities for growth, inclusion, and further investment. India is now home to 100 unicorns with a total valuation of USD 332.7 billion. The Ministry of Commerce & Industry recently said that 1 out of every 10 unicorns globally have been born in India.

We have witnessed fast-paced digitisation and improvement of the technology infrastructure in these past few years. India's ranking on Global Innovation Index (GII) has also climbed up to 46th position from the earlier 48th position in 2020. A big chunk of this success is attributed to the growth of startups; in the past decade. Innovation in India is not limited to certain sectors but has been witnessed in varied sectors like IT services, healthcare, education, professional and commercial services, agriculture, food and beverages. 

According to the Economic Times Survey of 2022, startups in India have grown remarkably over the last six years. The number of new recognised startups has increased to over 14,000 in 2021-22 from only 733 in 2016-17. India has burgeoned into the 3rd largest startup ecosystem after the US and China. With the rise of tech startups - India’s growth trajectory will further increase.</p>

            		<h3>Innovation</h3>
            		<p>Global demand for innovative products and digital services is surging, making it an attractive opportunity for both non-traditional and traditional funds to look for new investment opportunities</p>
            		<p> Startups are attempting to respond to shifting consumer demand in the face of a rapid shift to digitalization. The majority of new technology businesses are related to fintech, although effective attempts to digitalize real estate, marketing and pharmaceuticals have also been made. With hedge funds entering the private funding market and investing billions of dollars in disruptive businesses, there are currently more than 900 digital startup companies worth $1 billion, up from only 80 in 2015. Hedge funds and other non-traditional investors are pouring money into startups, resulting in greater valuations and more leverage for entrepreneurs. Non-traditional investors were involved in 42 per cent of startup funding deals, according to Pitchbook, and those deals accounted for more than three-quarters of the invested capital last year</p>
